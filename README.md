**Summary:** \
This project aims to develop a Bayesian model for visual perception tasks, specifically for discriminating between pairs of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is used to create prototype images of '5' and '8' which are then distorted to create images of varying categorical ambiguity. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract features from the images, and a Bayesian model is fit to estimate the probability that an image belongs to one of the two categories. The model's ability to replicate human judgments of the images is evaluated to assess its ability to capture the perceptual magnet effect in visual stimuli.
